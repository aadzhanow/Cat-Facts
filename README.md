# Getting Started

To use Cat Facts, simply download and install the app on your iOS device. When you open the app, you'll be presented with a randomly selected cat fact, along with an introductory phrase to make it more engaging.

# Usage
The app has a "Refresh" button that allows you to generate a new random cat fact to learn.

# Code

The app was created using Swift programming language and Xcode IDE. The app follows the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern. The ViewController.swift file contains the code for the app's UI, which includes two UILabels for the introductory phrase and cat fact, and a button to refresh the cat fact.

The CatFactsBrain.swift file contains the model, which has an array of cat facts and an array of introductory phrases. It also has two functions to generate a random fact and a random phrase.
